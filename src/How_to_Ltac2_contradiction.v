(** ** 1. Introduction

    We write a variant of the [contradiction] tactic up to small differences.
    The overall specification [contradiction] is that it can take an argument or not:

    If [contradiction] does not take an argument, then [contradiction]:
    1. First introduces all the variables,
    2. Try to prove the goal by checking the hypothesis for:
      - A pair of hypotheses [p : P] and [np : ~P], such that any goal can be
        proven by [destruct (np p)]
      - An hypothesis [i : I] such that [I] is an inductive type without any constructor
        like [False], i.e. such that any goal can be proven by [destruct i]
      - An hypothesis [ni : ~I] such that [I] is an inductive type with
        one constructor without arguments, like [True] or [0 = 0].
        In other words, such [I] is provable by [constructor 1].

    If [contradiction] takes an argument [t] then, the type of [t] must either be:
    1. An empty like [False], in which case the goal is proven
    2. Or a negation [~P], in which case:
        - There is a hypothesis [P] in the context, then the goal is proven
        - Otherwise, the goal is replaced by [P]

    In this how-to we will see how to code it using Ltac2.

(** ** 2. Matching the goal for [P] and [~P]

    *** 2.1 Choosing [lazy_match!], [match!] or [multi_match!]

    To look up for a pair of hypotheses [P] and [~P], we need to match the goal.
    There are three commands to match the goal that have different behaviour
    regarding backtracking. The first step is to understand which one we want to use.

  - [lazy_match! goal with] is the easiest command to understand and to use.
    [lazy_match!] picks a branch, and sticks to it to even if the code excuted
    after picking this branch (the body of the branch) leads to a failure.
    It will not backtrack to pick another branch if a choice leads to a failure.
    In practice, it is sufficient for all applications where matching the syntax
    is enough and deterministic.

    For instance, in the example below, it picks the first branch as everything
    match [ |- _], choice that leads to failure. It stick to it and fails.
*)

Goal False.
  Fail lazy_match! goal with
  | [ |- _ ] => printf "branch 1"; fail
  | [ |- _ ] => printf "branch 2"
  | [ |- _ ] => printf "branch 3"
  end.
Abort.

(** - [match! goal with] picks the first branch that succeeds.
      If it picks a branch, and evaluation of its body fails, then it backtracks
      and choose the next branch where the pattern matches the hypotheses and goal,
      potentially the same one if all the hypotheses have not been exhausted yet.

      [match!] is useful as soon as matching the syntax is not enough, and we
      need additional tests to see if we have picked the good hypotheses or not.
      Indeed, if such a test fail raising an exception (or we make it so),
      then [match!] will backtrack, and look for the next hypotheses matching the pattern.

      In the example below the first branch is picked and fails, it hence
      backtracks to its choice.
      There is only one possibility for the pattern [ |- _] as it matches any goal.
      As it has already been tried, it hence switch to the second pattern which is [ |- _].
      This branch now succeeds, the whole [match!] hence succeeds.
*)

Goal False.
  match! goal with
  | [ |- _ ] => printf "branch 1"; fail
  | [ |- _ ] => printf "branch 2"
  | [ |- _ ] => printf "branch 3"
  end.
Abort.

(** - [multi_match! goal with] is more complex and subtle. It basically behaves
      like [match!] except that it will further backtrack if the choice of a
      branch leads to a subsequent failure when linked with another tactic.

      For instance, in the example below we link the [match!] with [fail],
      hence the composition of will hence fail.
      In the [match!] case, it will try the first branch, then the second that
      succeeds, then try [fail] which fails, hence fails. It will hence
      print [branch 1] and [branch 2] then fails.
*)
Goal False.
  Fail match! goal with
  | [ |- _ ] => printf "branch 1"; fail
  | [ |- _ ] => printf "branch 2"
  | [ |- _ ] => printf "branch 3"
  end; fail.
Abort.

(** In contrast, when failing on [fail], [multi_match!] will further bracktrack
    to its choice of the second branch, and try the next branch.
    The idea is that picking a different branch could have led to the subsequent
    tactic to succeed, as can happen when using [constructor].
    Here, as [fail] always fails, it will still failed but we can see it did
    backtrack and that the third branch as been tried as it will print [branch 3].
*)

Goal False.
  Fail multi_match! goal with
  | [ |- _ ] => printf "branch 1"; fail
  | [ |- _ ] => printf "branch 2"
  | [ |- _ ] => printf "branch 3"
  end; fail.
Abort.

(**   [multi_match!] is meant to write tactics performing a choice, and that
      we want to link with other tactics, like the [constructor] tactic.
      It is **not meant** to be used by default.
      Yes, it is the more powerful in terms of backtracking, but it can can be
      hard to understand and predict in particular for newcomers, and costly.

      The [contradiction] tactics is meant to solve goals with a simple enough
      inconsistent context. It is not meant to be linked with other tactics.
      Consequently, we have no use for [multimatch!] to implement [contradiction].


    Choosing betwen [lazy_match!] and [match!] really depends if we need
    more than a syntax check as we will see in the rest of this how-to guide.
*)


(** *** 2.2 Matching Syntactically or Semantically *)

(** Whether we choose to use [lazy_match!] or [match!], there are different
    way to match for [P] and [~P]. We can match the syntax directly, or match
    it semantically that is up to some reduction, conversion or unification.

    This different options have different levels of expressiveness, allowing them
    to match hypotheses to varying degrees. They also have different cost and side
    effects, for instance, conversion does not unify evariables opposite to unify.

    Understanding which strategy to choose is not easy. We will now discuss
    the different options, and their pros and cons, before choosing one.


    **** 2.2.1 Matching Syntactically

    Except for non-linear matching, matching is by default syntactic.
    That is, terms are matched and compared only up to α-conversion and evar expansion.
    To match for [P] and [~P], we can use the pattern [p : ?t, np : ~(?t)].
    In this pattern, [t] is non-linear so it will be matched up to conversion.
    However, matching for a term of the form [~(_)] will be syntactically,
    i.e. up to α-conversion.

    If we have found hypotheses [P] and [~P], then we can prove [False].
    Consequently, this is deterministic and we can use [lazy_match!] for it.
*)

Goal forall P Q, P -> ~Q -> ~P -> False.
  intros.
  lazy_match! goal with
  | [p : ?t, np : ~(?t) |- _ ] => printf "Hypotheses are %I,%I,%t" p np t
  | [ |- _ ] => printf "There are no hypotheses left to try"; fail
  end.
Abort.

(** Once we have found [P] and [~P], we want to prove [False] using the usual
    [destruct] tactic that expects a Rocq term, that write [destuct (np p)].
    However, this is not possible as though, as [p : ident] and [np : ident] are
    identifiers, i.e. the name of the hypotheses [P] and [~P], wheras [destruct X]
    expects [X] to be a Rocq term.

    To get the terms associated to [p] and [np], we must use [Control.hyp : ident -> contr],
    which transforms an [ident] corresponding to an hypothesis into a Rocq term
    we can manipulate in Ltac2, that is, into an object of type [constr].
    If there are no such hypotheses then it raises an error.
    For [p] and [np], this gives us:

    [[  let p := Control.hyp p in
        let np := Control.hyp np in
        ...
    ]]

    Once, we have gotten the term associated to the hypotheses with [Control.hyp],
    we must go back to Rocq's world to be able to use [destruct].
    We do so with [$], which leads to:

    [[
      let p := Control.hyp p in
      let np := Control.hyp np in
      destruct ($np $p)
    ]]

    Note, there is currently no notation to do [Control.hyp] and [$] at once.

    This leads us to the following script:
*)

Ltac2 match_PnP_syntax () :=
  lazy_match! goal with
  | [p : ?t, np : ~(?t) |- _ ] =>
        printf "Hypotheses are %I,%I,%t" p np t;
        let p := Control.hyp p in
        let np := Control.hyp np in
        destruct ($np $p)
  | [ |- _ ] => printf "There are no hypotheses left to try"; fail
  end.

Goal forall P Q, P -> ~Q -> ~P -> False.
  intros. match_PnP_syntax ().
Qed.

Goal forall P, P -> (P -> nat) -> False.
  intros. Fail match_PnP_syntax ().
Abort.

(** It has the advantage to be fast but the downside is that it will not match
    [?t -> False], even though it is convertible to [~(?t)], as [~(_)] is
    match syntactically.
    It is not what we want for a [contradiction] tactic.
*)

Goal forall P, P -> (P -> False) -> False.
  intros. Fail match_PnP_syntax ().
Abort.

(** To deal with [?t -> False], we could be tempted to add an extra-pattern in
    the definition, but this would not scale as any variations around [~] would fail.
*)

Goal forall P, P -> ((fun _ => ~P) 0) -> False.
  intros. Fail match_PnP_syntax ().
Abort.

(** Checking terms up to syntax is not a good notion of equality in type theory.
    For instance, [4 + 1] is not syntactically equal to [5].
    What we really want here is to compare type semantically, i.e. up to
    some reduction, conversion or unification.
*)

(** Note, however, that it would match [~((fun _ => P) 0)] as [t] in [~t] is
    matched up to conversion.
*)

Goal forall P, P -> ~ ((fun _ => P) 0) -> False.
  intros. match_PnP_syntax ().
Abort.

(** **** 2.2.2 Matching up to Unification

    Before considering a finer way to match syntax semantically, let us first
    consider how to match terms up to unification as it is what comes up
    first to mind when trying to write meta-programming.

    To match semantically, we must match for a pair of hypotheses
    [p : ?t1, np : ?t2 |- _], then check that [t2] is of the form [t1 -> False].
    Something fundamental to understand, here, is that with this approach the
    syntax check is no longer sufficient to be able to prove [False], as we match
    for any pair of hypotheses then check we have picked the good ones.
    We hence need to switch from [lazy_match!] to [match!] to be able to
    backtrack and try the next hypotheses, if we have picked the wrong ones.

    To unify the types, we can exploit that tactics do unification.
    For instance, we can ensure [t2] is of the shape [t1 -> X] by applying
    [$np] to [$p]; i.e. [$np $p], as otherwise it would be ill-typed.
    We also need to ensure [X] is [False], otherwise, [destruct ($np $p)]
    could do pattern matching on [nat] which would not solve the goal.
    We can ensure it does solve the goal by wrapping it in [solve].
    However, it is not an efficient solution, as we would still do [destruct] for
    every pair of hypotheses until we found one that works, which can be costly.
    A better solution, is to use a type annotation [$np $p :> False] to force the
    type of [$np $p] to be [False].

    This leads to the script:
*)

Ltac2 match_PnP_unification_v1 () :=
  match! goal with
  | [p : ?t1, np : ?t2 |- _ ] =>
        printf "Hypotheses are %I : %t, and %I : %t" p t1 np t2;
        let p := Control.hyp p in
        let np := Control.hyp np in
        destruct ($np $p :> False)
  | [ |- _ ] => printf "There are no hypotheses left to try"; fail
  end.

Goal forall P Q, P -> ~Q -> ~P -> False.
  intros. match_PnP_unification_v1 ().
Qed.

Goal forall P, P -> (P -> nat) -> False.
  intros. Fail match_PnP_unification_v1 ().
Abort.

Goal forall P, P -> (P -> False) -> False.
  intros. match_PnP_unification_v1 ().
Qed.

Goal forall P, P -> ((fun _ => ~P) 0) -> False.
  intros. match_PnP_unification_v1 ().
Qed.

(** While this technically works, a better and more principled approach is to
    directly use the primitive [Std.unify : constr -> constr -> unit] that
    that unifies two terms, and raises an exception if it is not possible.

    With this approach, there are much less chances to make an error,
    like misunderstanding how unification is done by the tactics, or
    forgetting the type annotation [: False].

    Moreover, it scales much better. Conversion is only available for
    Rocq 9.1 and later versions, so we will not utilize it in this how-to guide.
    However, if it were available, we could essentially replace [Std.unify]
    with [Std.conversion] to obtain the alternative version.
    One could even consider parametrising the code by a check that could later
    be instantiated with unification, conversion or some syntax check up to
    reduction, like to the head normal form.
*)

Ltac2 match_PnP_unification_v2 () :=
  match! goal with
  | [p : ?t1, np : ?t2 |- _ ] =>
        printf "Hypotheses are %I : %t, and %I : %t" p t1 np t2;
        Std.unify t2 '($t1 -> False);
        printf "Unification Worked!";
        let p := Control.hyp p in
        let np := Control.hyp np in
        destruct ($np $p)
  | [ |- _ ] => printf "There are no hypotheses left to try"; fail
  end.

Qed.

Qed.

(** An issue with unification is that it can unify evariables.
    For instance [match_PnP_unification_v2] can solve the following goal
    which is not the case for the usual [contradiction] tactic.
*)

Goal forall P Q, P -> ~Q -> False.
  intros. eassert (X4 : _) by admit.
  match_PnP_unification_v2 ().
Abort.

(** This is costly, but also not a very good practice for automation tactics
    which should not unify evariables in the behind the scene as it can
    unify them in an unexpected way getting the users stuck later.
    Users should have control on whether evariables are unified or not, hence
    the different e-variants like [assumption] and [eassumption].

*)

(** **** 2.2.3 Matching up to Reduction

    To have finer control on what happens and reduce the cost of unification,
    we can instead reduce our types to a head normal form to check it is of the
    form [X -> Y] as [->] is a infix notation, (it should be seen as [-> X Y]).
    We can then check that [X] is [t1], and [Y] is [False].

    To reduce terms, there are many primitives in [Std]. We want to reduce to the
    head normal form so we can use directly [Std.eval_hnf : constr -> constr].
    We can then match the head with [lazy_match!] with the pattern [?x -> ?y].
    We use [lazy_match!] as this is deterministic, either our term is a product
    or it is not.

  [[
    match! goal with
    | [p : ?t1, np : ?t2 |- _ ] =>
          let t2' := Std.eval_hnf t2 in
          lazy_match! t2' with
          | ?x -> ?y => printf "(%I : %t) is a product %t -> %t" np t2 x y;
          | _ => printf "(%I : %t) is not product" np t2;
          end
    | [ |- _ ] => printf "There are no hypotheses left to try"; fail
  ]]

    We then have to compare [X] with [t1], and [Y] with [False]. We would like to
    compare terms up to conversion as it is reasonably inexpensive, but still
    very expressive. Unfortunately, there is no primitive for it at the moment.

    Consequently, we compare them up to syntactic equality which is still very
    expressive when combine with reduction [Constr.equal : term -> term -> bool].
    This is gives us the following script to which we add some printing functions
    to see what is going on.
*)

Ltac2 match_PnP_unification_v3 () :=
  match! goal with
  | [p : ?t1, np : ?t2 |- _ ] =>
        printf "Hypotheses are %I : %t, and %I : %t" p t1 np t2;

        | ?x -> ?y =>

(** **** 2.2.4 Optimisation

    Using reduction already provides us with a fine control over what is going on
    but it still is a bit inefficient as we try to compare every pair of hypotheses.
    What we can instead is look for a negation [~P], and only if we found check
    for an hypothesis [P]. This basically amounts to spliting the match in
    two parts. As it can be seen, it matches much fewer hypotheses in case of failure.

(** *** 2.3 Error Messages

  So far, we have been using [fail] to trigger failure, which returns
  the error message [Tactic_failure None].

  We can be finer using the primitive [Control.zero : exn -> 'a] to raise an error.
  We can then raise a custom error message using [Tactic_failure : message option -> exn]
  that raises an error for any given message.
  We can then write complex error message using [fprintf] that behaves as [printf]
  excepts that it returns a [message] rather than printing it.

(** ** 3. Using Constr.Unsafe and Ind API to Add Syntactic Checks

    We need to check for hypotheses that are either empty like [False], or
    of form [~t] where [t] is an inductive type with one constructor without
    arguments like [nat] or [0 = 0] that we can prove with [constructor 1].

    We can do so very directly by trying to solve the goal assuming we have
    found the good hypotheses wrapping it in [solve] to ensure it works.
    In this case, for [p : t] and [np : ~t] that would mean doing
    [solve [destruct $p]] and [destruct ($np ltac2:(constructor 1))].
    However, that would be very inefficient as we would do [destruct] on
    any hypothesis, which can be expensive.

    A better approach is to add a syntax check that verify that [t] is of the
    appropriate form. It is much cheaper as it is basically matching syntax.
    We can do so by using the API [Constr.Unsafe] that enables to access the
    internal syntax of Rocq terms, and [Ind] to access inductive types.

    The API "unsafe" is named this way because as soon as you start manipulating
    internal syntax, there is no longer any guarantee you create well-scoped terms.
    Here, we will only use it to match the syntax so there is nothing to worry about.

(** *** 3.1 Checking for Empty and Singleton Types

    In both case, the first step is to check if the term is an inductive type.
    Internally, a type like [list A] is represented as [App (Ind ind u) args]
    where [ind] is the name of the inductive and the position of the block,
    and [u] represents universe constraints.
    Consequently, given a [t : constr] we need to decompose the application
    [App x args], then match [x] for [Ind ind u].

    This can be done using [Unsafe.kind : constr -> kind] which converts a
    [constr] to a shallow embedding of the internal syntax, which is defined
    as a Ltac2 inductive type [kind].
    [kind] is a shallow embedding which means a [constr] is not fully
    converted to a representation of the internal syntax, only its head.
    For example, the type of [Unsafe.App] is [constr -> constr array -> kind].
    That is, [u] and [v] in [Unsafe.App u v] remain regular [constr] elements
    and are not recursively converted to [kind], which characterizes it as shallow.
    In contrast, if we had a deep embedding, the arguments of [Unsafe.App] would be
    recursively converted to [kind], resulting in the type [kind -> kind array -> kind].
    The reason for using a shallow embedding is that it is much faster than fully
    converting terms to the internal syntax, yet sufficient for most applications.

    Let us first write a function [decompose_app] that translates a [constr] to
    [kind], then match it for [Unsafe.App] and returns the arguments.
    It is already available starting Rocq 9.1, but it still is good to recode it.

    There are two things to understand here:
    - 1. We match [kind] using [match] and not with [match!] as [kind] is an
         inductive type of Ltac2. [match!] is to match [constr] and goals.
    - 2. We really need the shallow embedding: we can not match the type of a
         term as we did for [X -> Y]. Indeed, we can match [X -> Y] with [match!]
         as we know there are exactly 2 arguments, so the syntax is fully specified.
         In constrasts, an application like an inductive type could have arbitrary
         many arguments, and we can hence not match it with [match!]
*)

Ltac2 decompose_app (t : constr) :=
  match Unsafe.kind t with
    | Unsafe.App f cl => (f, cl)
    | _ => (t,[| |])
  end.

(** Getting the inductive data associated to an inductive block is similar.
    We first use [decompose_app] to recover the left side of the application,
    we then convert to the syntax to check if it is an inductive, in which case
    we recover the inductive definition with [Ind.data : inductive -> data].

    A subtlety to understand is that [Unsafe.kind] converts the syntax without
    reducing terms. So if we want [(fun _ => True) 0] to be considered as an
    inductive, we need to reduce it first to a head normal form with
    [Std.eval_hnf : constr -> constr].
 *)

Import Ind.

Ltac2 get_inductive_body (t : constr) : data option :=
  let (x, _) := decompose_app (Std.eval_hnf t) in
  match Unsafe.kind (Std.eval_hnf x) with
  | (Unsafe.Ind ind _) => Some (Ind.data ind)
  | _ => None
  end.

(** We are ready to check if a type is empty or not, which is now fairly easy.
    Given the definition of an inductive type, it suffices to get the number
    of constructor with [nconstructors : data -> int], and check it is zero.
*)

Ltac2 is_empty_inductive (t : constr) : bool :=
 match get_inductive_body t with
 | Some ind_body => Int.equal (Ind.nconstructors ind_body) 0
 | None => false
 end.

(** We can check an inductive type is a singleton similarly, except to one small issue.
    The primitive to access the arguments of a constructor is only available in
    Rocq 9.1 or above. So for now, we will hence only check that it has only one constructor.
    Though this is not perfect and forces us to wrap [destruct ($np ltac2:(constructor 1)]
    in [solve], it still rules out most inductives like [nat].
*)

Ltac2 is_singleton_type (t : constr) : bool :=
  match get_inductive_body t with
  | Some ind_body => Int.equal (Ind.nconstructors ind_body) 1
  | None => false
  end.


(** *** 3.2 Checking for Empty and Singleton Hypotheses

    Writing a tactic to check for empty hypothesis is now fairly easy.
    We just match the goal using [match!] as the syntax check is not complete,
    then check if it is empty, and if it is, prove the goal with [destruct $p].
*)

Ltac2 match_P_empty () :=
  match! goal with
  | [ p : ?t |- _ ] =>
        let p := Control.hyp p in
        if is_empty_inductive t then destruct $p else fail
  | [ |- _ ] => Control.zero (Contradiction_Failed (Some (fprintf "No such contradiction")))
  end.

Goal False -> False.
  intros. match_P_empty ().
Qed.

Goal True -> False.
  intros. Fail match_P_empty ().
Abort.

(** Checking for the negation of an inductive type is a little bit more involved
    as we need to check the type of [?] is of the form [?X -> False].
    We can do so by creating a fresh evariable of type [Type] with
    [open_constr:(u :> Type)] then using [Std.unifiy]:
*)

Ltac2 match_nP_singleton () :=
  match! goal with
  | [ np : ?t2 |- _ ] =>
      let np := Control.hyp np in
      lazy_match! (Std.eval_hnf t2) with
      | ?x -> ?y =>
        if Bool.and (is_singleton_type x) (Constr.equal (Std.eval_hnf y) 'False)
        then solve [destruct ($np ltac2:(constructor 1))]
        else printf "%t is not a singeleton or %t is not False" x y ; fail
      | _ => printf "%t is not product" t2; fail
      end
  | [ |- _ ] => Control.zero (Contradiction_Failed (Some (fprintf "No such contradiction")))
  end.

(** ** 4. Putting it All Together *)

(** It took a few explanations, but in the end the code of [contradiction_empty]
    is rather short using Ltac2.

    To be efficient, we first perform the syntax check as there are very cheap.
    We hence first check for an empty hypotheses, then if it is a negation,
    in particular of a singletion inductive type. If it is none of these,
    check for [P] and [~P] which we perform last in order not to check
    the whole context for nothing.
